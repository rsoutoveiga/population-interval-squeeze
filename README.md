Non-spatial process-based population model to simulate fire-killed, serotinous plants. The model is licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0

Model was implemented in C++11, compiled in MinGW 7.3.0 32-bit, and in gcc 4.8.5 (Red Hat 4.8.5-44). Simulation results were analysed with R v3.5.3 (R Core Team 2019). For data visualization we used the R packages ‘ggplot2’ v3.3.2 (Wickham 2016) and ‘plotly’ v4.9.2.1 (Sievert 2020).
